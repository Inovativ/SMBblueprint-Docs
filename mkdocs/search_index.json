Subsequent users that have the same group specified will be a regular member.\n    * The created groups will be private Office Groups\n* License (the license to assign to the user, expressed as the SKU code, which can be found using get-msolaccountsku -TenantId \\<ID of your CSP tenant\\>)\n    * You can get the tenant-id's under your CSP account by connecting to your root Azure AD with 'Connect-MSOLService' and then querying the tenants with 'Get-MSOLPartnerContract -All|select DefaultDomainName,TenantId'\n\n>**Example CSV:**  \nFirst,Last,Title,DisplayName,Department,Office,Mobile,Country,Groups,License  \nJan,Van Meirvenne,Consultant,Jan.VanMeirvenne,ICT,Inovativ,32478707741,BE,TestGroup1,O365_BUSINESS_PREMIUM  \nJin,Van Meirvenne,Consultant,Jin.VanMeirvenne,ICT,Inovativ,32478707741,BE,TestGroup10,O365_BUSINESS_PREMIUM  \nJon,Van Meirvenne,Consultant,Jon.VanMeirvenne,ICT,Inovativ,32478707741,BE,TestGroup10,O365_BUSINESS_PREMIUM \n\n### Mail Domain\n\nBefore this solution is used, a validated custom domain needs to be present in the tenant's configuration.\nBy default, the tenant domain that is marked as default will be used as primary mail suffix. A specific domain can be chosen by providing the '-MailDomain <MailDomainName>' parameter (in the GUI, an option to control this is available as well).\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: While using the standard \n@onmicrosoft.com suffix is not blocked, the user won't be able to send/receive mails.\n```\n\n\nDefault Password\n\u00b6\n\n\nA parameter 'DefaultPassword' can be passed. This sets the initial logon for ALL users in the CSV to a specific password. If the parameter is omitted, a random password is generated.\n\n\nPreflight check\n\u00b6\n\n\nBefore starting the provisioning, a few conditions are checked:\n\n The CSP credential must be valid\n\n The entered Tenant ID or Domain must be present in the CSP partner's directory\n    * Note: Do not confuse the tenant-domain with the tenant's own domains. The tenant domain is the value that is shown in the CSP portal, and not the tenant's admin portal!\n* The licenses specified in the CSV-file must not be more that the ones available in the subscription\n\n\nCSP Admin account\n\u00b6\n\n\nNot all resources can be reliably deployed by the CSP model currently. This consists of:\n\n Onedrive For Business\n\n Office 365 groups\n\n\nTo work around this limitation, the deployment will use the CSP credential to create an admin user within the tenant itself, and proceed to use this last one to configure the restricted resources.\nThe password for this user is randomly generated and renewed everytime the SMbBlueprint solution is ran. This means that the CSP admin user can not be used for login without manually resetting the password.\nThe password is not stored in any outputs.\n\n\nProvisioning\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen all checks are passed OK, the CSV information is used to commence the actual provisioning.\n\n\nThis happens in the following order:\n1) Create the users in the tenant's Azure AD, set the password and license information\n\n If a user already exists, no action is performed\n2) Connect to the Exchange interface of O365 and create the groups. Assign ownership based on the CSV-information.\n\n If a group already exists, no action is performed\n3) Populate the standard memberships for the created groups\n4) Bulk provision all created users' OneDrive using the Sharepoint Online Management shell\n\n\nReview\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen the provisioning completes, an object is returned containing the following information:\n\n Type (the deployment-type. This will be 'Office' for deployments started with this function)\n\n Duration (the duration of the deployment)\n\n Status (Provides status-information for the deployment)\n    * Configuration (contains several outputs of the deployment)\n        * ProvisionedUsers (a list of all provisioned users including login-information)\n        * ProvisionedGroups (a list of all provisioned office groups)\n\n Completed (equals 'TRUE' if the deployment is done)\n\n Error (if an exception occured during the deployment, it will be stored here)\n\n Log (the full location of the logfile for the deployment)",

You do not see these components as separate entities, instead you see them as related and interdependent parts of a single entity. You want to deploy, manage, and monitor them as a group. Azure Resource Manager enables you to work with the resources in your solution as a group. You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation. You use a template for deployment and that template can work for different environments such as testing, staging, and production. Resource Manager provides security, auditing, and tagging features to help you manage your resources after deployment.\n\n\nTerminology\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you are new to Azure Resource Manager, there are some terms you might not be familiar with.\n\n\n\n\nresource\n - A manageable item that is available through Azure. Some common resources are a virtual machine, storage account, web app, database, and virtual network, but there are many more.\n\n\nresource group\n - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. See Resource groups.\n\n\nresource provider\n - A service that supplies the resources you can deploy and manage through Resource Manager. Each resource provider offers operations for working with the resources that are deployed. Some common resource providers are Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the virtual machine resource, Microsoft.Storage, which supplies the storage account resource, and Microsoft.Web, which supplies resources related to web apps. See Resource providers.\n\n\nResource Manager template\n - A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group. It also defines the dependencies between the deployed resources. The template can be used to deploy the resources consistently and repeatedly.

By using a template, you can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout its lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state. When you create a solution from the portal, the solution automatically includes a deployment template. You do not have to create your template from scratch because you can start with the template for your solution and customize it to meet your specific needs. You can retrieve a template for an existing resource group by either exporting the current state of the resource group, or viewing the template used for a particular deployment. Viewing the exported template is a helpful way to learn about the template syntax.\n\n\nIn its simplest form, a template contains the following elements:\n\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\n  \"contentVersion\": \"\",\n  \"parameters\": {  },\n  \"variables\": {  },\n  \"resources\": [  ],\n  \"outputs\": {  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nparameters element\n, you specify values that enable customization and flexibility in deployment.\n For example, you can pass parameter values that tailor deployment for your test environment. \n By specifying the parameters, you can use the same template to deploy your solution to different environments.\n\n\nIn the \nvariables element\n, you specify values that are reused throughout the template, or values\n that are constructed from other values (like parameters).\n\n\nIn the \nresources element\n, you specify the components of your infrastructure. \nYou define as many resources as your solution needs.\n\n\nIn the \noutputs element\n, you specify any values that are returned from the deployment \n(such as URIs from deployed resources).\n\n\nAzure Resource Manager analyzes dependencies to ensure resources are created in the correct order. \nIf one resource relies on a value from another resource (such as a virtual machine needing a storage \naccount for disks), you set a dependency.\n\n\nYou do not have to define your entire infrastructure in a single template. Often, it makes sense to \ndivide your deployment requirements into a set of targeted, purpose-specific templates. \nYou can easily reuse these templates for different solutions. To deploy a particular solution, \nyou create a master template that links all the required templates.\n\n\nYou can also use the template for updates to the infrastructure. For example, you can add a resource\n to your solution and add configuration rules for the resources that are already deployed. \n If the template specifies creating a resource but that resource already exists, \n Azure Resource Manager performs an update instead of creating a new asset.
