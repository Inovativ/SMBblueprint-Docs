You do not see these components as separate entities, instead you see them as related and interdependent parts of a single entity. You want to deploy, manage, and monitor them as a group. Azure Resource Manager enables you to work with the resources in your solution as a group. You can deploy, update, or delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation. You use a template for deployment and that template can work for different environments such as testing, staging, and production. Resource Manager provides security, auditing, and tagging features to help you manage your resources after deployment.\n\n\nTerminology\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you are new to Azure Resource Manager, there are some terms you might not be familiar with.\n\n\n\n\nresource\n - A manageable item that is available through Azure. Some common resources are a virtual machine, storage account, web app, database, and virtual network, but there are many more.\n\n\nresource group\n - A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. See Resource groups.\n\n\nresource provider\n - A service that supplies the resources you can deploy and manage through Resource Manager. Each resource provider offers operations for working with the resources that are deployed. Some common resource providers are Microsoft.Compute, which supplies the virtual machine resource, Microsoft.Storage, which supplies the storage account resource, and Microsoft.Web, which supplies resources related to web apps. See Resource providers.\n\n\nResource Manager template\n - A JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines one or more resources to deploy to a resource group. It also defines the dependencies between the deployed resources. The template can be used to deploy the resources consistently and repeatedly. See Template deployment.\n\n\ndeclarative syntax\n - Syntax that lets you state \"Here is what I intend to create\" without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. The Resource Manager template is an example of declarative syntax. In the file, you define the properties for the infrastructure to deploy to Azure.\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of using Resource Manager\n\u00b6\n\n\nResource Manager provides several benefits:\n\n\n\n\nYou can deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group, rather than handling these resources individually.\n\n\nYou can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state.\n\n\nYou can manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts.\n\n\nYou can define the dependencies between resources so they are deployed in the correct order.\n\n\nYou can apply access control to all services in your resource group because Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.\n\n\nYou can apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription.\n\n\nYou can clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate deployment\n\u00b6\n\n\nWith Resource Manager, you can create a template (in JSON format) that defines the infrastructure and configuration of your Azure solution. By using a template, you can repeatedly deploy your solution throughout its lifecycle and have confidence your resources are deployed in a consistent state. When you create a solution from the portal, the solution automatically includes a deployment template. You do not have to create your template from scratch because you can start with the template for your solution and customize it to meet your specific needs. You can retrieve a template for an existing resource group by either exporting the current state of the resource group, or viewing the template used for a particular deployment. Viewing the exported template is a helpful way to learn about the template syntax.\n\n\nIn its simplest form, a template contains the following elements:\n\n\nCopy\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\n  \"contentVersion\": \"\",\n  \"parameters\": {  },\n  \"variables\": {  },\n  \"resources\": [  ],\n  \"outputs\": {  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nparameters element\n, you specify values that enable customization and flexibility in deployment.\n For example, you can pass parameter values that tailor deployment for your test environment. \n By specifying the parameters, you can use the same template to deploy your solution to different environments.\n\n\nIn the \nvariables element\n, you specify values that are reused throughout the template, or values\n that are constructed from other values (like parameters).\n\n\nIn the \nresources element\n, you specify the components of your infrastructure. \nYou define as many resources as your solution needs.\n\n\nIn the \noutputs element\n, you specify any values that are returned from the deployment \n(such as URIs from deployed resources).\n\n\nAzure Resource Manager analyzes dependencies to ensure resources are created in the correct order. \nIf one resource relies on a value from another resource (such as a virtual machine needing a storage \naccount for disks), you set a dependency.\n\n\nYou do not have to define your entire infrastructure in a single template. Often, it makes sense to \ndivide your deployment requirements into a set of targeted, purpose-specific templates. \nYou can easily reuse these templates for different solutions. To deploy a particular solution, \nyou create a master template that links all the required templates.\n\n\nYou can also use the template for updates to the infrastructure. For example, you can add a resource\n to your solution and add configuration rules for the resources that are already deployed. \n If the template specifies creating a resource but that resource already exists, \n Azure Resource Manager performs an update instead of creating a new asset. Azure Resource Manager \n updates the existing asset to the same state as it would be as new.\n\n\nPractical Examples\n\u00b6",
